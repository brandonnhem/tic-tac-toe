# tic-tac-toe
An interactive game of tic-tac-toe that is powered by Processing.

# Pre-reqs:
Download ![Processing ide](https://processing.org/download/)     (if you can run processing, you can run our game!)

# To get the game working:
1.) Create a folder called "TicTacToe". 
2.) Download the .pde file and place it the folder you just created.
3.) Then place the two png files in the same folder.
4.) Open the .pde file
5.) Press the play button on the top left corner

# Objective:
To play the game, you will be playing against a bot and hopefully **beat** that bot. To defeat the bot, you will have to place your marking (X's or O's) with **three** in a row. That can be three across, three down, or three diagonally. Be warned the bot has a few tricks up its sleeves to try and defeat you. You might lose or you might tie! A loss is when the bot gets three in row __before__ you do. A tie is when either you or the bot do not win and you are out of spots to play. Think carefully as there are only 9 total plays that occur between you and the bot.

# Instructions:
Once open, begin the game by clicking on any spot in the 9 x 9 grid. When you are greeted with a win, lose, or tie screen, press the spacebar to restart the game. Or you could close the game and open it again.
